            high school I was the varsity swim captain and made my way onto the
            Boston Globe and Boston Heralds’ “All Scholastic Athletes” list, so
            ya, you could say I’m kind of a big deal amongst the followers of
            Massachusetts’ northern section’s high school swimming community…
            oh god did I peak in high school?</p>

      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <div class="content" id="skill">
        <h4>Object Oriented Programming</h4>
        <p>For years I have taught and worked in Java and have had the
        fundamentals of object oriented programming ingrained in me. For my
        latest project in Java, I created an algorithm to mimic the Huffman
        Compression system.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content" id="skill">
        <h4>Some languages</h4>
        <p>Java has been my go-to language for years, but through Husky Robotics
        I have also practiced Python, and through web programming I have become
        comfortable with HTML, CSS and Javascript as well.</p>
        <p>For Husky Robotics I wrote an algorithm to interface with a
        quadrature encoder that will be used on the rover being created for the
        University Rover Challenge.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content" id="skill">
        <h4>Self Taught Visual Effects Enthusiast</h4>
        <p>For the past three years I have been developing music visualizers for
          the artist Total Convergence. My latest rendition included (but was not
          limited to) the audio spectrum, fractal noise, turbulent displacement
          and polar coordinate effects along with dynamic scripting to create a
          simple yet elegant design that fits the tone of the music.

      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <div class="content" id="job">
        <h4>AP Computer Science</h4>
        <p>Throughout my senior year I helped peers work through coding and
          logic problems, and it helps that I solidified fundamentals of object
          oriented programming along the way.

      <div class="content" id="job">
        <h4>Housing and Food Services</h4>
        <p>There are almost 2,000 people that live in the University of
          Washington’s north campus. On a typical shift, I clean their
          kitchenware… all of it. So how is working at a kitchen relevant?
          Let’s just say I know how to hustle.

        <h4>AB Tsunamis</h4>
        <p id="trigger">Throughout high school I helped establish the swimming
          abilities of 6-14 year olds in my community.
          <p id="popup">If you think communicating with adults is hard, imagine
            teaching twenty or so rowdy elementary schoolers in a pool.

          was and how to make it.
